 SOL_INSTRUMENTALITY_CAT:0 "An Empty World"
 SOL_INTRUMENTALITY_1_DESC:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the world below is... Unusual. There are indications of a relatively advanced civilization on the world but sensors aboard [Root.GetName] detect no life signs; the poles of the planet are cold enough to harbor ice caps but only the northern ice cap is present; and the oceans... Are red. \n\nFurther investigation is recommended."
 
 endtimesanom.1000.name:0 "Completely Empty"
 endtimesanom.1000.desc:0 "The mystery on [From.GetName] only becomes more perplexing as information is uncovered. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the world is more empty than previously expected: there is no life here at any level. While the planet fits perfectly within models that predict an abundance of life, there is a lack of living plants and animals. Samples of the soil and water indicate that there is not even microscopic life, except that which we have brought with us.\n\nThe red color of the seas, which Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] remarks is startlingly reminiscent of hemoglobin, was found to be due to an abundance of simple organic compounds. Under the right conditions the seas could potentially harbor abiogenesis, the spontaneous generation of life, however Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] does not believe that it is possible in the current environment provided by the planet.\n\nThe ruins are the most perplexing part of the mystery. They show certain evidence that they are artificial but the areas in their vicinity are just as devoid of life as the rest of the planet. The sprawling cities cover the world, crowding against the shorelines and even, in many places, continuing beneath the waves. Numerous trinkets were recovered from the submerged areas, suggesting that the residents must have had little warning to evacuate. Whatever event melted the southern ice-cap, then, was relatively sudden such that the residents had to evacuate without most of their belongings, if they managed to evacuate at all.\n\nOn an island chain at the rim of the largest ocean, a startling discovery was made: a geofront was excavated into one of the mountains. The purpose of this geofront isn't yet known, as it has partially filled with water, but the surrounding area shows indications of multiple battles including massive craters and what appear to be two gigantic suits of armor!\n\nA special project has been issued to study the area around the geofront and to determine the purpose behind such gargantuan armored beasts."
